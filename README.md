# Alpha Zero General (any game, any framework!)
A simplified, highly flexible, commented and (hopefully) easy to understand implementation of self-play based reinforcement learning based on the AlphaGo Zero paper (Silver et al). It is designed to be easy to adopt for any two-player turn-based adversarial game and any deep learning framework of your choice. A sample implementation has been provided for the game of Othello in PyTorch and Keras. An accompanying tutorial can be found [here](http://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html). We also have implementations for many other games like GoBang and TicTacToe.

To use a game of your choice, subclass the classes in ```Game.py``` and ```NeuralNet.py``` and implement their functions. Example implementations for Othello can be found in ```othello/OthelloGame.py``` and ```othello/{pytorch,keras}/NNet.py```. 

```Coach.py``` contains the core training loop and ```MCTS.py``` performs the Monte Carlo Tree Search. The parameters for the self-play can be specified in ```main.py```. Additional neural network parameters are in ```othello/{pytorch,keras}/NNet.py``` (cuda flag, batch size, epochs, learning rate etc.). 

To start training a model for Othello:
```bash
python main.py
```
Choose your framework and game in ```main.py```.

### Docker Installation
For easy environment setup, we can use [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker). Once you have nvidia-docker set up, we can then simply run:
```
./setup_env.sh
```
to set up a (default: pyTorch) Jupyter docker container. We can now open a new terminal and enter:
```
docker exec -ti pytorch_notebook python main.py
```

### Experiments
We trained a PyTorch model for 6x6 Othello (~80 iterations, 100 episodes per iteration and 25 MCTS simulations per turn). This took about 3 days on an NVIDIA Tesla K80. The pretrained model (PyTorch) can be found in ```pretrained_models/othello/pytorch/```. You can play a game against it using ```pit.py```. Below is the performance of the model against a random and a greedy baseline with the number of iterations.

### Contributing
While the current code is fairly functional, we could benefit from the following contributions:
* Game logic files for more games that follow the specifications in ```Game.py```, along with their neural networks
* Neural networks in other frameworks
* Pre-trained models for different game configurations
* An asynchronous version of the code- parallel processes for self-play, neural net training and model comparison. 
* Asynchronous MCTS as described in the paper

Some extensions have been implented [here](https://github.com/kevaday/alphazero-general).
